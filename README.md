#lbac (Let's Build a Compiler)

This repo contains the code I've written while reading "Let's Build a
Compiler" by Jack Crenshaw.

I've translated the instructions for i386 architecture (Quite poorly
if I may say so).

This is merely an experimental and educational compiler and way to
simple for a productional one. It is fun however :)
